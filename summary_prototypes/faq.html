            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

            <p>Below are common questions about the Supply & Demand Portal. If you don’t see the answer you need here, please email the <a href="mailto:SupplyDemand@careerbuilder.com?subject=SupplyDemand%20Portal%20FAQ">Supply &amp; Demand Team</a>.</p>

            <h2>Data Sources</h2>

            <h3>Is the Supply & Demand Portal based solely on CareerBuilder data?</h3>
            <div><p>The portal data is a combination of data sets, which is unique and de-duplicated. CareerBuilder job seekers provide their information in their resumes and online user registrations. We also include in the portal results the job postings that employers post on CareerBuilder.com.  In addition, we partner with external sources to broaden the data set and make it more robust. We want to give you the most complete picture possible about the current hiring landscape.  Our partner, EMSI, provides the total available workforce supply data, and Wanted Technologies provides the job postings data that is pulled from multiple sites across the Internet.</p></div>

            <h3>What is the source of the Job Postings?</h3>
            <div><p>The job postings data comes from Wanted Technologies, a job aggregator that crawls job board websites. Wanted de-duplicates the same job found on multiple websites and only reports to us one unique job posting in the portal. Wanted Technologies covers approximately 90% of the U.S. online job market and through this data partnership, we have detailed information on approximately 48 million job postings over the previous two years.</p></div>

            <h3>What is the source of Active Candidates?</h3>
            <div><p>Active Candidates are essentially the active job seekers on the CareerBuilder Network sites (CareerBuilder.com, Sologig.com, MiracleWorkers, and more). The number of Active Candidates reported represents job seekers who completed one of the following actions within the timeframe selected in the portal:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Posted a resume on the CareerBuilder Network,</li>
                <li>Modified a resume on the CareerBuilder Network, or</li>
                <li>Applied to a job posting using a resume saved on the CareerBuilder Network</li>
            </ul></div>

            <h3>What is the source of Total Available Workforce?</h3>
            <div><p>The Total Available Workforce data comes from our data partner: EMSI (Economic Modeling Specialists Inc). This number represents the total people currently employed in the displayed Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) as defined by ONET, the Occupation Network that works in conjunction with the Bureau of Labor Statistics. These counts represent the active and passive labor market. We include these counts as a way for you to see the full employment landscape.  Not all workers are actively looking for a new job right now, but they are skilled and currently employed in these jobs. EMSI completes labor market modeling based on information provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and over 90 state and private sources.</p></div>

            <h2>Data Cleansing and Updates</h2>

            <h3>How is duplicate jobs data being handled?</h3>
            <div><p>We have a de-duplicating process to handle duplicate jobs across multiple sites. We identify the duplicate jobs through the job description and company name. Duplicate postings of the same position are removed and not loaded into the portal.</p></div>

            <h3>How often is the data updated?</h3>
            <div><p>We update the portal on a monthly basis with the most recent month’s numbers. Due to the timing in which we receive data from our partners and the time required to process and test it, we typically update the portal around the 25th of the month for the prior month’s activities.</p></div>

            <h2>Data Usage</h2>

            <h3>What are some of the applications of this data?</h3>
            <div><p>You can use the data from the Supply & Demand Portal in a variety of ways. Many of our clients use it as a first step when they have an open position to fill. The client runs a search to see how difficult or easy it will be to hire for the position (looking at the supply and demand counts). The labor pressure tab provides a list of the easiest cities to recruit for that position – which can be very helpful for determining multiple location job postings. Clients use the supply tab’s demographics section to learn more about the experience level, education level, and other demographics about the pool of available candidates. Other clients use the portal to set expectations with the hiring managers or gain a seat at the table when the company is looking to expand. Knowing the hiring landscape allows you to make decisions based on solid data, instead of just guessing at what might work best. Here are some of the other applications for using the Supply & Demand data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce time that recruiters spend researching multiple sources</li>
                <li>Build cost effective recruitment strategies for hard to fill positions</li>
                <li>Identify talent competitors</li>
                <li>Determine common job titles for a given skill</li>
                <li>Conduct site location analysis for talent</li>
                <li>Establish labor cost for project bids</li>
                <li>Analyze labor market trends for any skill or position</li>
            </ul></div>

            <h2>Resume Database</h2>

            <h3>When I click on the link to review the resumes from the keyword search, why doesn’t the number of resumes in the resume database match the number of active job seekers?</h3>
            <div><p>There are three main reasons why this might occur:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have not purchased access to all of the CareerBuilder Network Resume Databases (niche sites like Miracleworkers and Sologig have their own databases).</li>
                <li>Some resumes are represented in more than one month of the search. For instance, if a job seeker created a resume in March, and modified the resume in April, then that job seeker is represented twice in the portal (presuming the search timeframe is longer than 1 month), but counted only once in the RDB.</li>
                <li>Resumes that have been posted by job seekers as "private" will be counted in the results in the portal, but these will not be displayed when you click on the link to the available resumes. Only public resumes, as determined by the individual job seeker, are displayed in the resume database.</li>
            </ul></div>

            <h3>When I click on the link to review the active resumes, does this lock up one of the RDB seats on my account?</h3>
            <div><p>Yes, the portal will verify that you have purchased a seat of the resume database and make sure that one license is available at that time before allowing you to search the active resumes. The RDB seat will be "locked up" by you until you release the seat by clicking on the "Release RDB License" link or by logging out of CareerBuilder.</p>
            <p class="img"><img src="http://img.icbdr.com/images/personified/sd-faq-rdb.png" alt="Releasing RDB License" /></p></div>

            <h2>Searching and Sending Reports</h2>

            <h3>How can I search in the portal for the best results? Do you have any tips?</h3>
            <div><p>We suggest that you search using the Boolean search methodology. By using the words AND and OR, you can include the keywords specific to the type of position you are looking to fill. We also recommend using quotes around keywords that are two or more words that you’d like to see exact matches for in the results.</p></div>

            <h3>Can I save a report and send to someone?</h3>
            <div><p>Use the "Export" menu on the right to download a report and send to a coworker. We offer three different report types: a one-page summary report, a multi-page full report, and a spreadsheet of multiple tabs that includes the raw data.</p>
